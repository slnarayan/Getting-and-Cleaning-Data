This file describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

Data downloaded from the following URL:
- https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

An R script performing the following steps was used to automate & consistently generate the tidy dataset:
- Data from the above data source was downloaded
- Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Export the resultant dataset to an external file ( courseprojectoutput.txt )

Output dataset has the following variables:
- subjectID
- activity
